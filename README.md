# Student Performance Analysis

## Problem Statement

Understanding the factors influencing student performance in exams is crucial for educators and policymakers. This project aims to analyze a dataset containing information about students' demographics and their test scores to identify patterns and factors influencing performance.

## Objective

The objective of this analysis is to determine how different variables such as gender, ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type, and test preparation course affect student test scores.

## Research Questions

1. Is there a difference between male and female scores?
2. What factors mainly influence the test scores?

## Tests Used

### Hypothesis Testing
- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: There is no significant difference between male and female scores.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: There is a significant difference between male and female scores.

### Linear Regression Analysis
Linear regression will be used to understand the relationship between various independent variables (gender, ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type, test preparation) and dependent variables (test scores).

## Conclusion

After conducting hypothesis testing and linear regression analysis, the following conclusions were drawn:

- **Difference Between Male and Female Scores**: Hypothesis testing showed that there is a significant difference between male and female scores.
- **Effect of Lunch Type on Test Scores**: Students with a standard type of lunch tend to have higher test scores compared to those with free/reduced lunch.

By understanding these findings, educators and policymakers can focus on interventions that can help improve student performance.
